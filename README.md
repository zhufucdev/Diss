# Desktop Integrated Scheduling System

Some micro hardware project to bring the busy schedule
right in front of you

## How to build

Need some monitor, so that you can see the pixels

The one I choose is some GDEY075Z08 E-Paper display.

If interested, instructions are available in that repository

## How to program

Check out `main.py`

I wrote a graphic library for this project, namely epui. Check
its repo [here](https://github.com/zhufucdev/epui).

I also wrote a display driver, which can be found [here](https://github.com/zhufucdev/gdey075z08_driver).

This driver is built for raspberrypi. If you want to reproduce in other platforms,
just write yours.
